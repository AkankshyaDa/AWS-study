1> In Private VPC by default subnet and internet gateway, NAT gateway will not create, we have have to create it seperately.
2> In one region maximum by default 5 VPCs we cancreate, if want more then we need to raise request to AWS Support and can create.
3> We can create Private VPC, internet gatway and subnets within  AWS free tier account, for NAT gateway it will charge.
4> Private VPC can't connect to internet directly, it can connect through NAT gateway then NAT gateway to internet gate way then it will connect to internet.
5> NAT gateway can be host in public subnet.
6> There are 2 types of VPC
	a> Default VPC - Each AWS account comes with a default VPC in each region. It is automatically configured with a subnet in each Availability Zone and allows for easy setup of instances with public IPs.
	b> Custom VPC - Users can create their own VPCs tailored to specific needs. This includes defining the IP address range, subnets, route tables, and gateways.

1> how to calculate CIDR range in CIDR VPC with simple example
ans:- 10.0.0.0/16 = 10.0.0-255.0-255 10.0.0.0 and 10.0.255.255
	here in the above example first(10.0) 16 bits are represent to network part and remaining 16 bits (0.0) represent for host.
	10.0.0.0/16 here 10.0 can't be cahnge rest 10.0.0-255.0-255 can be modify
	10.0.0.0 this IP can't be use (this is the starting address and not usable for hosts)
	10.0.255.255 this IP can't be use (this is the last address in the range and not usable for hosts)
	Total usable ips 2 the power (32−16) − 2 = 65,534 usable addresses (subtracting 2 for the network and broadcast addresses)
so here 172.31.0.0/16 means 172.31.1-254.1-254
